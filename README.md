## About
I am ready to take on a full web-scraping and data analysis project.  I have learned to identify HTML elements on a page, identify their id and class attributes, and use this knowledge to extract information via both automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup. I have also learned to scrape various types of information. These include HTML tables and recurring elements, like multiple news articles on a webpage.  In this Challenge, I will be using my core skills: collecting data, organizing and storing data, analyzing data, and then visually communicating your insights.  

## Getting Started
Jupyter Notebook is required to run this project.
